## How do I get the content pulled in?

The backend takes care of populating all product names (anything added in as a product node) and correct links to the product overview pages. 

Content creators can add a 'Title' to be visible to the user as an H2. Creators can also add in additional content via the CK editor, which will appear right above the backend-populated product links.

## Do I have any choices for how this assembly displays on the page?

This assembly always takes on the same display appearance. Below is how the assembly will always present itself.
