  The 'Curated Content' assembly is a flexible and easy way to render links in a
  card format with an image and title (with option to make that title linkable).
  You can display the following with this assembly:


  **Title (optional)**


  **Cards (required)**\

  - Static item: add an image of your own choice, provide a title for the card, and make that title linkable if you'd like\

  - Node reference: type in the name of a piece of content that already exists, and Drupal will format the title, image, and link accordingly


  **Button linking out to whatever you'd like (optional)**
