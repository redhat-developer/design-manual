## How do I get the content pulled in?

As with most assemblies, you can add a title. Then, there are two routes for getting content pulled into a curated links assembly. 

* **Node reference:** you just start typing in the name of the article, video, etc. and drupal will auto-create the link and link text for you
* **Static item:** You choose the text you want to be displayed to the user as a link, and then provide what URL that link will take the user to.
