## What content types can I add this assembly to?

1. Articles
2. Pages
3. Events
4. Products
5. Topics

## **How do I get the content pulled in?**

There are two routes for getting content pulled into a curated links assembly. 

1. **Node reference:** you just start typing in the name of the article, video, etc. and drupal will auto-create the link and link text for you
2. **Static item:** You choose the text you want to be displayed to the user as a link, and then provide what URL that link will take the user to. 

## **Do I have any choices for how this assembly displays on the page?**

We can display curated links in three different formats using 'Display styles'.

* Display styles: **\--none---**

  ![curated link without display styles](/design-manual/assets/uploads/curated-link.png)
* Display styles: **horizontal navigation**

* Display styles: **two-column**
