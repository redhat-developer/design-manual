  The curated links assembly can be used as a way to manually select content to be linked off from on a page (as opposed to a collection assembly automatically bringing links in based on a keyword).

## What content types can I add this assembly to?

View example usage of the curated links assembly in production on the [Quarkus product page](https://developers.redhat.com/products/quarkus/getting-started) and the [Serverless topic page](https://developers.redhat.com/topics/serverless-architecture)

* Articles 
* Pages
* Events
* Products
* Topics

## How do I get the content pulled in?

As with most assemblies, you can add a title. Then, there are two routes for getting content pulled into a curated links assembly. 

* **Node reference:** you just start typing in the name of the article, video, etc. and drupal will auto-create the link and link text for you
* **Static item:** You choose the text you want to be displayed to the user as a link, and then provide what URL that link will take the user to. 

## Do I have any choices for how this assembly displays on the page?

We can display curated links in three different formats using 'Display styles'.

* Display styles: **--none--**

* Display styles: **horizontal navigation**

* Display styles: **two-column**
