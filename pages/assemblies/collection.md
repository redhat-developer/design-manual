  With this assembly, the content creator can provide an assembly title, then
  selects purpose attributes of their choice from a defined list of terms, and
  lastly must select how many items should display (pagination is also available
  as an opt-in feature). 


  Drupal will find content (articles, blogs, videos, etc.) tagged with those selected purpose attributes and display those items as cards in a grid layout.
