# Reporting Security Issues

Thank you for taking the time to report a security issue. We understand that this takes time to report and, as such, will be sure to respond quickly and acknowledge any contributions to the project.

Security reports must include:

- Design Manual version
- Operating system and version (Windows, macOS, Linux+Distribution)
- Node Version (i.e. 12.18.4)
- Ruby Version (i.e. 2.6.3)
- Gem version
  - `gem "jekyll", "~> 3.8.7"`
  - `gem "github-pages", "206"`
- Dependency version in question (i.e. `"@patternfly/patternfly": "2.65.2"`)

If possible, include any links to documentation that you have found, as well as possible fixes.
